# DL on Medical Image
  - [Antibody-supervised deep learning for quantification of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in hematoxylin and eosin stained breast cancer samples](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5027738/)

- [x] more usefull tools should be added in.
  - [x] Read and process process data as needed by the network.
  - [x] Read [`Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder–Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation`](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1078.pdf) and implement a GRU.
